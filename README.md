## Description

ZeDocs is a WordPress theme that allows you to easily create a comprehensive documentation system. It adds a custom post type for articles to be displayed, as well as the ability to use basic WordPress posts. The theme also provides a theme options system to customize colors, logo, favicon, fonts, changelog, and roadmap. Additionally, a setup wizard allows you to install all necessary plugins and demo content for a pre-installed site. Articles are based on the Elementor plugin, with integration of several custom widgets for the theme (zoomable image, formatted code space, progress bar, alerts), and you can of course add any widgets available in Elementor.
